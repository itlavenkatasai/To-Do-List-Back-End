# To-Do List Back End

     This application is mainly used to create the server,
     to-do list APIs and to save to-do list items to the MongoDB.
     🚀 Excited to share my latest project!

📌 Description: This repository contains the backend code for the ToDo website, a full-stack web application built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The backend provides RESTful API endpoints for user registration, login authentication, and task management functionalities.

🎯 Goals: The main objectives of this backend project were to implement secure user authentication, handle CRUD operations for tasks, and ensure seamless integration with the frontend for data exchange.

💡 Key Features:

API Development:

Created RESTful API endpoints using Express.js to handle user registration, login authentication, and CRUD operations for tasks.
Utilized HTTP methods such as POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE for interacting with the frontend and managing data in the MongoDB database.
User Authentication:

Implemented user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to securely authenticate and authorize users for accessing ToDo list functionalities.
Utilized bcrypt.js for securely hashing user passwords before storing them in the database.
Database Integration:

Integrated MongoDB as the database to store user information and task data, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval.
Utilized mongoose for MongoDB interactions, providing schema validation and data modeling capabilities.
✨ Achievements:

Successfully developed a robust backend infrastructure to support user authentication and task management functionalities.
Implemented secure authentication mechanisms to protect user data and ensure confidentiality.
Seamless integration with the frontend for efficient data exchange and communication.
👨‍💻 Tech Stack:

Node.js: Used as the backend runtime environment.
Express.js: Employed for building RESTful API endpoints and handling HTTP requests.
MongoDB: Utilized as the database for storing user information and task data.
Security: Implemented bcrypt.js for password hashing and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication.
Other modules: mongoose for MongoDB interactions, dotenv for environment variables.
📈 Results: The backend repository played a crucial role in the success of the ToDo website project by providing secure authentication, efficient data management, and seamless integration with the frontend.
